Create Excel files with Haskell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fork of [libxlsxwriter](https://github.com/HalfWayMan/libxlsxwriter)
that tries the improve on the api and provide a library for
creation of Excel files.
Underneath the hood it uses C library called [libxlsxwriter](http://libxlsxwriter.github.io/) and provides
bindings to C code to produce Excel 2007+ xlsx files.
